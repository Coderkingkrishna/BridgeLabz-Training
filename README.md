# Day 01 – C# Basics

## 📌 Overview
This day focuses on building a strong foundation in **C# programming** by practicing basic programs and understanding important theoretical concepts such as the history of C#, IL (Intermediate Language), compiler vs interpreter, and differences between Java and C#.

---

## 🧪 Programs Implemented
The following C# programs were implemented to understand basic syntax, data types, and mathematical operations:

1. **Average of Numbers**
2. **Add Two Numbers**
3. **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion**
4. **Kilometers to Miles Conversion**
5. **Perimeter of a Rectangle**
6. **Area of a Circle**
7. **Power of a Number**
8. **Simple Interest Calculation**
9. **Volume of a Cylinder**

Each program helps in understanding:
- Input and output handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Use of variables and data types
- Basic formulas in C#

---

## 📘 Theoretical Concepts Learned

### 🔹 History and Evolution of C#
- C# was developed by **Microsoft** in the early 2000s.
- Designed by **Anders Hejlsberg**.
- Part of the **.NET Framework**.
- Object-oriented, modern, and type-safe language.
- Evolved continuously with new features like LINQ, async/await, records, etc.

---

### 🔹 IL (Intermediate Language)
- C# code is not compiled directly into machine code.
- It is first compiled into **IL (Intermediate Language)**.
- IL is executed by the **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**.
- Enables platform independence within the .NET ecosystem.

---

### 🔹 Compiler vs Interpreter

| Compiler | Interpreter |
|--------|-------------|
| Translates entire code at once | Translates code line by line |
| Faster execution | Slower execution |
| Errors shown after compilation | Errors shown one by one |
| Example: C#, C, C++ | Example: Python, JavaScript |

---

### 🔹 Difference Between Java and C#

| Java | C# |
|-----|----|
| Platform-independent via JVM | Platform-independent via CLR |
| Uses JVM | Uses CLR |
| No pointers | Supports pointers (unsafe mode) |
| Checked exceptions | No checked exceptions |
| Slower GUI | Faster Windows-based applications |

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Learned basic C# syntax and programs
- Understood how C# code is compiled and executed
- Gained clarity on IL, compiler vs interpreter
- Compared Java and C# for better conceptual understanding

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Day 01 helped in building a strong base for C# programming by combining **hands-on coding** with **important theoretical concepts**, setting the stage for advanced topics in upcoming days.

# Day 02 – C# Operators & Data Types

## Overview
Day 02 focused on understanding **C# data types**, **operators**, and the purpose of the `static void Main` method, which serves as the entry point of a C# application.

---

## Concepts Covered
- **Data Types**
  - Value types and reference types
  - Common built-in data types (int, float, double, char, bool, string)

- **Operators**
  - Arithmetic operators
  - Relational operators
  - Logical operators
  - Assignment operators

- **static void Main**
  - Entry point of a C# program
  - `static` allows execution without creating an object
  - `void` indicates no return value
  - `Main` is invoked by the CLR at runtime

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Language: C#  
- Framework: .NET  
- Environment: Visual Studio / `csc`

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained understanding of C# data types and operators
- Learned how expressions are evaluated
- Understood the role of `static void Main` in program execution

---

## Conclusion
Day 02 strengthened core C# fundamentals by explaining how data is stored, manipulated, and how program execution begins.
