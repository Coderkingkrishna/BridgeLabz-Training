# 📅 Day 1 – Linked List (C#)

## 🚀 Topic Start
Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations.
Each node contains:
- Data
- Reference (pointer) to the next or previous node

This topic focuses on understanding different types of linked lists and their real-world applications.

- Advantages and disadvantages of linked lists

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How pointers/references work internally
- How to dynamically grow data structures
- How different linked list types solve different problems
- How circular structures avoid null references

---

## ✨ New Things Learned
- Circular Linked List for Round Robin scheduling
- Doubly Linked List for Undo/Redo functionality

Linked Lists provide flexibility in memory usage and dynamic data handling.
Understanding them builds a strong foundation for advanced data structures like trees and graphs.

# 📅 Day 2 – Stack & Queue (C#)

## 🚀 Topic Start
Stack and Queue are linear data structures used to manage data based on order of processing.

- Stack → LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Queue → FIFO (First In First Out)

These structures are widely used in system-level and real-world applications.

---

## 📚 Theory Learned
### Stack
- Push, Pop, Peek operations
- Function call stack
- Recursion handling

### Queue
- Enqueue, Dequeue operations
- Task scheduling
- Buffer management

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How stacks manage function execution
- Why queues are used in scheduling systems
- Difference between stack and queue use cases
- How data flow changes based on access rules

---

## ✨ New Things Learned
- Implementing queue using stack logic
- Sliding window technique using queue
- Using stack for undo/redo and expression problems

---

## 🏆 What I Achieved
- Solved multiple stack and queue problems
- Understood internal working instead of using built-in classes
- Improved logical thinking for sequential processing

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
Stack and Queue simplify complex flow control problems.
They are essential for understanding recursion, scheduling, and system design.


# 📅 Day 3 – Dictionary & HashSet (C#)

## 🚀 Topic Start
Dictionary and HashSet are hash-based data structures designed for fast access and efficient lookups.

They are essential for optimizing performance in large-scale applications.

---

## 📚 Theory Learned
### Dictionary
- Stores data as Key-Value pairs
- Fast retrieval using hashing
- Used for mapping and frequency counting

### HashSet
- Stores unique values only
- No duplicate elements
- Fast membership checking

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Why hashing provides O(1) average time complexity
- When to use Dictionary vs HashSet
- How collisions are handled internally

---

## ✨ New Things Learned
- Solving frequency-based problems efficiently
- Removing duplicates using HashSet

---

## 🏆 What I Achieved
- Improved performance-focused thinking
- Reduced time complexity of multiple problems
- Learned how real-world applications handle fast searches

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
Hash-based data structures are crucial for writing efficient and scalable code.
Mastering them improves both coding speed and solution quality.


# 📅 Day 4 – Sorting Algorithms (C#)

## 🚀 Topic Start
Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order (ascending or descending).
It plays a critical role in searching, optimization, and data analysis.

---

## 📚 Theory Learned
### Comparison-Based Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Non-Comparison Sorting
- Counting Sort

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Time and space complexity of each algorithm
- Difference between stable and unstable sorting
- When to use recursive vs iterative sorting
- Importance of divide and conquer approach

---

## ✨ New Things Learned

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
Sorting algorithms form the backbone of efficient data processing.
Understanding them deeply improves algorithmic thinking and interview readiness.
